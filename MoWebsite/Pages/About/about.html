                    Thanks for tunning into my about me. As for introduction, my name is Muhamad Kataw and
                    I'm currently a 22 year old trying to figure out what sticks on the wall. Throughout
                    this journey of experiments, I've concluded that the most promising intrests lies in 
                    Programming and Finance. Growing up I've always had a drive for investing. Whether it
                    was taking money and setting it aside for stocks or choosing not to spoil my self with
                    fancy clothes/materialistic items, I wanted to keep piling money into my investments.
                    However, after working in retail throughtout college I realized that my current income 
                    would only take me so far until my investments would payoff. So to combact this conflict
                    I had to invest in my self. I would then pick up skills such as programming and begin on 
                    working on multiple projects with friends and classmates. It just so happened that I enjoyed
                    coding while I was learning it. Every time I solved a problem a flash of dopamine would propel
                    me to the next problem. To be honest it's a love hate situation. But once you're in the zone
                    it is hard to go to sleep with out completing the task you orginally had. I wanted to finish 
                    this off by saying that pushing ourselves is a great feeling but it just as important to enjoy
                    ourselves throughout the journey. It's not what's at the end of the tunnel but what you pick up 
                    throught out the tunnel. -Muhamad Kataw
